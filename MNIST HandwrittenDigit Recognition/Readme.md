# Handwritten Digit Recognition
### The handwritten digit recognition uses the images of digits from dataset and recognizes the digit present in the image.
### Role of each layer in Deep Neural Network - CNN, Pooling, Dense
#

## Dataset - MNIST
### The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. It has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
